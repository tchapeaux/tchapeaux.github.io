## The gallery

TL;DR: click the thumbnail.

## Background

[Portal](http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html) is still one of my favorite game ever. So when Valve announced [Portal 2](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/) back in 2010, I was very excited. So much that I decided to translate every promotional video on [my Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVQ6mGATFAo&list=PLE9CDCB93C4AE5791) (yep, that's how I roll), which ended up super fun as their promotional videos were cute, inventive, and full of comedic timing (the most satisfying thing to get right with close-caption, in my opinion).

I was achieving my self-imposed fanboy quest without fail, so back in 2011 when Valve released a [27 pages comic](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/comic/?l=en) to link the story of the two games one week before the game release, I knew what I had to do. Having little knowledge of comic translation, I downloaded a readable comic font, launched The Gimp and tried my best to fit my lengthy translation into the english-sized text bubbles. Three days later, I had it on a friend's server (with a custom Javascript gallery) and posted it to a few places.

It got some views, then two weeks later Valve posted an official translation and no one visited it ever again. Of course, being a little pedantic about translations, I find mine far more precise, natural and overall superior to the official one. But I'm not complaining, it was a fun and challenging experience.

Anyway, I wanted to see the online gallery recently and found out it was no longer available. I lost track of the friend who hosted it so I put it on an [Imgur gallery](http://imgur.com/a/ExgIB) for posterity.

## Just for fun: some nitpicks with the official translation

Note that it's probably easy to do the same for mine. I don't know what sort of constraints and previous knowledge they had for the official translation, and I'm sure they did their best, but as a fan I have to second-guess some of their choices:

* They were lazy and only translated the speech bubbles. I took the time to modify the environment texts when they were relevant to the action.
* The turrets say their catchphrase from the first game ("Target acquired", etc). They translate it literally rather than using the translation from the game.
* **pp. 4** "Ne fait pas ça !": The correct imperative form is "fais".
* **pp. 5** "...des caméras dans les caméras" We lose the fact that *they* put cameras in the cameras, which make the dialog confusing.
* **pp. 5** "This will be the end of us" is *not* the same as "Ce sera fini entre nous". It concentrate too much on the (probably unintentional) double meaning while distancing itself from the original one. Really bad translation in my opinion.
* **pp. 6** So, for me here, "Whatever you say" is supposed to show the relationship between the rat and his companion cube. He's tired, not trusting his own judgment, and has complete confidence in the cube to keep him from turrets. I find the line touching and I like how it works after the mad monologue. Their "Peu m'importe" lose all that for me.
* **pp. 9** "Quelle en est la signification", while correct, is not something any native speaker would say (especially in this context).
* **pp. 10** Dude. If the question was "Quelle en est la signification", the answer can't be "Une seule explication". You have to use the same word, or else it looks like two lines translated independently.
* **pp. 11** Personal preference here: I think that two colleagues speaking familiarly to each others use "tu" rather than "vous" to address each other. I often see french translator defaulting to "vous" when it can create a distance not present in the original.
* **pp. 11** Why did you try to use fancy words when the two dudes are obviously just chatting? Turning a machine on is not the same as "Faire une session", and saying that the machine tried to "supprimer" when the original is "kill" also seems weird to me.
* **pp. 12** Like at page 6, "I'm sure you're right" was touching and showed how the two characters rely on each other. "Probablement" just make it look like they are bored.
* **pp. 14** "It's dragging her back inside." So... I'm aware that french doesn't have a neutral pronoun like "it", and that using "ça" is the closest thing to the actual meaning, but I think that for a humanoid robot using "il" would be more natural.
* **pp. 15** "You can always ignore your conscience". Why did you have to make the translation machine-specific ("a conscience can always be short-circuited") when that line was clearly about how HE was ignoring his conscience. This infuriates me when the literal translation would work perfectly but the translator somehow felt the need to get fancy.
* **pp. 15** "It's my fault she's down here" Why does your translation lose this bit when it's his main argument?
* **pp. 15** Translating "Then you really are crazy" with "This is crazy" loose a lot of meaning.
* **pp. 16** Here the cube is fading away, and the text color gets lighter to reflect that. This is lost in the official translation.
* **pp. 20** "Have you refilled your prescription lately ? / Bite me", their translation ("Sans moi !") does not work as an answer to the question.
* **pp. 20** Their translation of GladOS' monologue lose most the irony.
* **pp. 21** "Is it just coincidence (...) ?" This one's pretty bad. GladOS asks a rhetorical question for which the answer is clearly no. The translation turns it into an affirmation "It is a coincidence that (...)" which is confusing and plain wrong. The worst part is that the second part ("how likely are the chances?") is correctly translated but does not make any sense after the botched translation of the first part.
* **pp. 21** In general the translator seems confused by GladOS' style of monologue: full of tangents, exaggeration and badly disguised psychological manipulations. So when she says she has proven that "reality does not exist", you have to translate that literally, however stupid it may sound. Softening the statement as "The theory is not verified" is boring.
* **pp. 22** That's not how you use "ni" in French 
* **pp. 23** Again, don't try to rationalize what GladOS is saying. If she says there is a "Bring your cat to work day", don't change that into "employee pet contest".
* **pp. 24** "How did you know about the girl? / Know what? / That she was the one." This is the worst one for me, as it completely miss the point of the dialog, which is the setup for the twist at the end. The translation is basically "How do you know this girl? / What? / How do you know it's her?" which makes it sound like the rat knew Chell previously, when the whole point is that he chose her based on her file alone.
* **pp. 25** "You can patch her cryo-unit ...", the translation says "It would be fitting to...", which makes me think that the translator thought that the cube had a distinguished speech pattern, but it's just not the case. Really weird choice.
* **pp. 25** A note for all the translators out there: NO ONE SAYS "CELA" IN SPOKEN FRENCH. EVER. ALWAYS USE "ÇA" (except in official text).
* **pp. 25** "It's the long sleep... or the long sleep." Why get fancy? The original text clearly used two times the same wording. I agree it would be weird in french, but it would not be any weirder than in english.
* **pp. 27** Aaaaand... You forgot to translate the last line on the piece of paper. I agree it's pretty basic English and difficult to change because it's turned, but if you don't translate it you lose the whole ending twist.
