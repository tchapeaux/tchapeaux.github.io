## My improv career so far

I started improv in 2011. I was starting my third year of Computer Science study and began to realize that I was always hanging with the same kind of people. I knew some people at [Impro-Vocation](www.impro-vocation.org) (the Improv Club of my university) and thought, what the hell. 

An improv club is a strange thing with a wild energy. People from all horizons seem to find something in the practice, resulting in a mix of beliefs and personalities which was, for me, engrossing. My best memories at Impro-Vocation are not about doing improv, but about connecting with those people and feeling accepted. The group is welcoming to a point that I find preciously rare, so much that improv is now my number one occupation outside of my studies.

Anyway, after that cheese, I quickly realised that while I loved watching improv and learning how to do it, I rarely enjoyed actually DOING it. Maybe because I like to feel in control and want everything I do to be perfect, two things whose absence is to be embraced by a competent improviser.

Another reason was that, coming from a scientific background, I was not used to learning artistic concepts from different teachers with different point of views. While there exist some "beginner's rules" ("Never say NO, but YES, AND--", "Don't ask questions", "Know each other"), they quickly feel artificial and limiting, and beyond that most teachers either offer a personal and sometimes incomplete vision or teach a more technical skill (how to impersonate a character, how to make the environment palpable, i.e. "how to do stuff" rather than "which stuff to do").

*Please note that I'm not being dismissive of those teachers. We usually booked teachers for four weekly session of three hours each, which is barely enough to get one medium-sized point across. I really thing we would gain something by keeping the teachers longer, but oh well.*

Anyway, long story short, I decided to blow dust off my e-reader and try to read some books about improv, in the hope to complete my personal picture of "which stuff to do" in improv by sitting on the shoulder of giants (in this case, improv book writers).

The first book I wanted to read was [Impro I, by Robert Gravel](http://www.amazon.fr/dp/1760901660) (the reference of the french-speaking improv world), but it was out of stock and there was no ebook version. So instead I read:

## Improv for everyone, by Greg Tavares

While idly looking at the [/r/improv subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/improv), I saw a discount on the kindle version of [Improv for everyone](http://improvbook.org/). Some guy said passionately that this book was genius, and I decided to believe him. Spoiler: he was right.

The book came out fairly recently (2012) and claim to teach *"What to do, step by step, to create awesome scenes"*. It is aimed at the general public (not professional actors) and is the summation of 25 years of doing, watching and teaching improv by Greg Tavares, the author. 

What I really, *really* liked was the methodical approach the author brought to doing improv. There is a place for spontaneity and surprise, but within a process allowing them to be understood and integrated. His method is structured without feeling too restrictive (more on that later), and each point is thoroughly justified at the theoretical level and with precise examples.

The book is divided into two parts: a theoretical one (which stuff to do) and a coaching-oriented one (which exercises allow you to do the good stuff intuitively). Let's review them separately.

### First part: Theory

The hardest part of improv (amongst every other parts) is, for me, the start of a scene. The fear of the void is perfectly described in the book and cleverly linked with the negativity of most beginners scene. Tavares' book's first half is mainly focused on those moments in each scene, when the two improvisers discover the scene they are going to play together and which end with *The Click*, where you can just *be* your character and continue the scene without thinking too much about it.

To do so, each improviser must know when a scene if fully defined, and what to add while it is not. The steps to a fully defined scene are:

1. *The Noodles*: Establishing the 5 scenic elements (CREPP)
    + **C**haracters
    + **R**elationship
    + **E**nvironment
    + **P**oint of view
    + **P**oint of attack
2. *The Sauce*: Explore your point of view until you find your Primary Emotional Drive
3. *The Spice*: Heighten your Primary Emotional Drive

At Impro-Vocation, we usually explain improv as "Who/What/Where + Why", with Who/What/Where being three pillars of a scene, and Why being the motor helping the story progress. I feel like Tavares' method is just an extension of this, like if you consider:
* Who = Characters
* What = Point of attack
* Where = Environment
* Why = Point of view / Primary Emotional Drive

### Second part: Exercises

The second part of the book seemed boring at first. I was here for the theory, to help build my vision of improv. But this section is really well structured and serve as a justification of the first part: each exercises is a logical next step to the previous one, and is thoroughly justified with regards to the theory of the first section.

To be honest, it made me really want to teach the method explained in the book to my improv peers. 

The main steps in the exercises are:

* Getting connected
    - Self-focus vs. Other-focus
    - Yes-and: building together
* Pre-scene
    - The five-step method: from input word to Initial Physical Offer
        + Input
        + Cascade
        + Selection
        + Specification
        + Manifestation
    - The Join
* The Noodles
    + Characters (Head, heart, body method)
    + Relationship (Relationship components)
        * History
        * Emotion
        * Status
        * Physicality, space and sensuality
    + Environment: (Where-four method)
        * Placement
        * Object
        * Activity
        * Time
* The Sauce
    + Discover Primary Emotional Drive: a point of view focused on the other
* The Spice
    - Heighten the Primary Emotional Drive using the Relationship Components
* Expert only: Believing in the world
    - Sense memory
    - Emotional recall
    - Substitution

### Limitations

So, I really liked Tavares' book. It is a thorough answer to the "which stuff to do" question I had about improv. Is is a technique to start great improv without feeling anxious about not knowing what comes next. However, it is not the definitive answer on improv (not that it claimed to be). For me, I see at least three specific points I would have to focus on and which are not covered at all in the book.

First of all, character techniques. That is, being able to create awesome characters which are both real and interesting. This, in my opinion, require to master technical skills (accents, body language, etc) and people skills (what makes a character real, emotional reaction, vocabulary, etc). I feel like I have only one rather bland character while doing improv, which is my extreme vision of a "protagonist". I would like to have more.

Secondly, story structure. This is a subject that I find fascinating to study in other mediums (see [Dan Harmon's Story Circle](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit)). For me, improv is a perfect story laboratory in that you can see "malformed" stories, and really understand how each story element is necessary to resonate in people. I feel like Tavares' method does not really allow for that, forcing improviser to fully explore their relationship without creating a large story (I say *large* story because it is possible to make a story with just a relationship, but there are *other* type of stories). In no point in the book does he talk about temporal ellipses, secondary characters, or what constitute a good ending. Those are things which, in my opinion, can and should also be discussed in the context of improv.

Finally, handling chaos. I think there is a difference between improviser goals and public expectation. Improvisers want to create a good, coherent story, scenes must "seem rehearsed" and create the illusion of an elaborate play. The public, on the other hand, is there to see acrobats make dangerous things. They want scenes to fail, and improvisers to skillfully put them back together.

This aspect of improv is, in my experience, rarely discussed. What should we do when someone contradicts what was previously defined, when you don't understand what your partner is doing, when your character want to do something that you don't want to do, etc. In that same spirit, the book does not address how well the method holds with improvisers who do not follow the method.

### Last words

So this is what that book made me think about. I feel like the book helped my improv, although much of it must be taught by exercises to become intuitive so I should talk about it to my team. In the meantime I'll read other books, because I really like hearing about mature and complex vision of improv, even if I may disagree on some points.
